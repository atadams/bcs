Breast cancer happens when there are abnormal cells in the breast. These abnormal cells do not grow like healthy cells. They can continue to grow and spread to other parts of the body.</p><h3>What is breast cancer screening?</h3><p>Breast cancer screening can find breast cancer early before signs or symptoms appear. When breast cancer is found at an early stage, it may be easier to treat or cure.</p><h3>What test is used for breast cancer screening?</h3><p>Mammograms are the most common screening test for breast cancer.</p><p>If you get a mammogram, your breasts will be put between two plastic plates in a machine that will take a picture with x-rays.</p><p>One breast at a time is put between the plastic plates. To get a clear picture, the plates will be pressed together, and your breasts will be flattened.</p><p>This may be a little painful, but your breasts are only flattened between the two plastic plates for less than a minute.</p><p>The mammogram machine will take a picture of the inside of each breast. Then an expert will look at the pictures for any growths that may look like cancer. If an abnormal growth is found, then you may need more testing to see if the growth is cancer.</p><h3>What about clinical breast exams and self-breast exams?</h3><p>Clinical breast exams and self-breast exams are not recommended for breast cancer screening.</p><h4>What is the recommendation for breast cancer screening for average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years?</h4><blockquote><p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is a group of volunteer scientific experts in preventive medicine that review the latest research findings to make recommendations for clinical preventive care.</p></blockquote><p>The USPSTF recommends that women who are 40 to 49 years old and are at average risk for breast cancer <em>make an individual choice with their health care professional</em> about when to start breast cancer screening.</p><p>Some women may decide to start breast cancer screening in their 40s instead of in their 50s because they feel the benefit of screening is greater than the potential harms of screening. Other women may decide to wait until their 50s because they feel the potential harms of screening is greater than the benefit of screening.</p><p>Talk with your health care professional to decide what is best for you.</p><h4>Why did the USPSTF make this recommendation?</h4><p>Researchers found that breast cancer screening lowers the chance of dying from breast cancer. There are also harms with breast cancer screening that women should know about in making a decision about when to start screening. The greatest benefit of screening happens when mammograms are performed every other year.</p><p>Breast cancer is less common in women in their forties. Younger women are more likely to have dense breasts compared to older women. Dense breasts appear white in the mammogram picture. This makes it hard to find cancer. As a result, the greatest benefit of screening happens when mammograms are done for older women compared to younger women.</p><p>For more information, see Module 4: What are the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening for average-risk women aged 40–49 years.</p><h2>What are the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening for average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years?</h2><h3>Where did these numbers come from?</h3><p><b><i>Data source for the benefits and harms (mortality benefit, false alarms, invasive procedures, and overdiagnosis)</i></b></p><p>These numbers are estimates from modeling. Modeling involves running data from the best available information in equations. Models do not predict the benefits and harms for an individual woman. Rather, they provide information for populations of women about various screening strategies (e.g., starting screening at age 40 vs 50). In addition, modeling makes assumptions about the population. For example, these models assumed that all women were average-risk and attended all screenings and received treatment.</p><div class="panel panel-benefit"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Benefit: <em>Greater chance of not dying from breast cancer</em></h3></div><div class="panel-body">Having breast cancer screening every other year lowers the chance of dying from breast cancer for women over age 40 years.</div></div><div class="panel panel-benefit" style="min-height: 600px; margin-right:-15px; margin-left:-15px"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Animation: The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening</h3></div><div class="panel-body"><div id="screening-chart__narration"></div><div id="screening-chart__table"><table class="table"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" style="width:38.8%"></th><th scope="col" rowspan="2" style="width:26.8%; height: 78px">No<br>Screening</th><th colspan="3" style="border-bottom: 0"><span class="screening-visible__fifties">Screening<br>starts at:</span></th></tr><tr><th scope="col" style="width:15.3%; border-top:0; font-size:22px; font-weight:700"><span class="screening-visible__fifties">50</span></th><th scope="col" style="width:19.1%; border-top:0; font-size:22px; font-weight:700"><span class="screening-visible__forties">40</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th scope="row">Deaths:</th><td>25</td><td><span class="screening-visible__fifties">18</span></td><td><span class="screening-visible__forties">17</span></td></tr><tr class="screening-visible__fifties"><th scope="row">Cases:</th><td></td><td class="screening-visible__fifties">151</td><td><span class="screening-visible__forties--cases">154</span></td></tr><tr class="screening-visible__fifties--falsealarm"><th scope="row">False Alarms:</th><td></td><td><span class="screening-visible__fifties--falsealarm">953</span></td><td><span class="screening-visible__forties--falsealarm">1,529</span></td></tr><tr class="screening-visible__fifties--biopsies"><th scope="row">Biopsies:</th><td></td><td><span class="screening-visible__fifties--biopsies">145</span></td><td><span class="screening-visible__forties--biopsies">213</span></td></tr><tr class="screening-visible__fifties--overdiagnoses"><th scope="row">Overdiagnoses:</th><td></td><td><span class="screening-visible__fifties--overdiagnoses">19</span></td><td><span class="screening-visible__forties--overdiagnoses">21</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="screening-chart--deaths--wrapper"><svg width="870" height="420" id="screening-chart--deaths"></svg></div><p><button onclick="advanceAnimation()" id="animation-advance-button">Start</button></p><div class="screening-visible__end"><button onclick="moveCohort('noScreening')">Without Screening</button> <button onclick="moveCohort('fifties')">Screened in 50s</button> <button onclick="moveCohort('forties')">Screened in 40s</button></div><p></p></div></div><div class="panel panel-benefit"><div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Harm: <em>Radiation exposure</em></h3></div><div class="panel-body"><p>Breast cancer screening gives a small amount of radiation and exposure to radiation can increase the risk of new cancers.</p><p>But, we do not know how much radiation is too much, especially when women are exposed to small amounts of radiation over many years from breast cancer screening.</p></div></div><h2>Deciding What Is Important To You</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>There are both benefits and harms with breast cancer screening.
